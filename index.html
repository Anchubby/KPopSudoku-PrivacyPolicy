<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 22, 2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes the manner in which K-Pop Sudoku ("Application", "Company", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information from users ("You", "Your") of our mobile application (the "Application"). By accessing or using the Application, You agree to the terms of this Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>The application does <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information ("PII") including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Phone numbers</li>
<li>Physical addresses</li>
<li>Account login credentials</li>
<li>Social media profiles</li>
<li>Sensitive personal information</li>
</ul>
<p>Users are not required to create accounts, submit contact information, or provide other PII to use the Application.</p>

<h2>2. Information Automatically Collected</h2>
<p>The Application integrates with <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, a third-party advertising service. AdMob may automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, IDFA)</li>
<li>Approximate location derived from IP address</li>
<li>Device model, operating system version, language, network information</li>
<li>Application usage and interactions, including ad engagement</li>
<li>Analytics for fraud detection and ad performance</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company does not have access to, nor stores, any of the data collected by AdMob. All such data is handled exclusively in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Use of Automatically Collected Data</h2>
<p>Data collected via AdMob is used solely for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivering and optimizing advertisements within the Application</li>
<li>Improving application performance and user experience</li>
<li>Preventing fraud and ensuring security</li>
<li>Compliance with applicable legal obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company does not use the collected data for remarketing beyond the scope required by AdMob.</p>

<h2>4. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>AdMob may utilize collected data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver personalized or non-personalized advertisements</li>
<li>Limit repeated ad impressions</li>
<li>Detect invalid traffic</li>
<li>Measure advertisement performance</li>
</ul>
<p>For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Application may display a consent prompt to allow or deny personalized advertisements. Users may also opt out of interest-based advertising via device settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
<li>iOS: Settings → Privacy → Tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. GDPR Compliance</h2>
<p>For users in the EU/EEA, the lawful basis for processing data is <strong>User’s Consent</strong>. Users have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of their data, withdraw consent, and object to processing. As the Company does not collect PII, many rights are exercised directly with Google: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2753860" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2753860</a>.</p>

<h2>6. CCPA and CPRA Compliance</h2>
<p>California residents have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), including the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request disclosure of collected information</li>
<li>Request deletion of personal information</li>
<li>Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information</li>
<li>Not be discriminated against for exercising these rights</li>
</ul>
<p>The Application does not sell personal information. Personalized advertising via AdMob may be considered "sharing" under California law.</p>

<h2>7. CalOPPA Compliance</h2>
<p>In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), this Policy is publicly accessible. Users may review it at any time via the Application or app store listing. The Company honors "Do Not Track" signals where supported.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.</p>
<p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
  
<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>While we take commercially reasonable measures to protect data, no transmission or storage method is completely secure. Data collected by AdMob is handled according to Google’s security policies.</p>

<h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Data is retained only as long as necessary for advertising, analytics, or legal compliance purposes. The Company does not store personal data.</p>
